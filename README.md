Class assignment: Computing the two-point angular correlation function

This is my home assignment from class Advanced Computer Graphics and Graphics Hardware,
I'm currently taking at Abo Akademi. The idea is to run given example program on GPU,
which otherwise calculates 'something something' and that proves existence of dark matter.
I'm not really good at physics so for me it's just 'something something', but who is 
interested can read this: http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3658
